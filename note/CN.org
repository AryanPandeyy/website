* RPC in Session layer
- RPC is working as a client-server model.
- RPC uses different Authentication methods to validate the client
  request.
- RPC protocol is independent of transport layer protocols.
- RPC requests can use both UDP and TCP but prefer UDP format.
** RPC authentication methods
1. Null Authentication
   - Calls such as caller does not know who he is or the server does
     not care who the caller is.
2. UNIX Authentication
   - The caller may wish to identify himself as he is identified in
     UNIX system.
3. DES Authentication
   - DES Authentication is the advanced form of UNIX Authentication.

* Congestion control in TCP (Explain with a diagram)
- TCP uses a congestion window and a congestion policy that avoid
  congestion.
- Congestion Policy
  1. Slow Start Phase
  2. Congestion Avoidance Phase
  3. Congestion Detection Phase
** Slow Start Phase
- In this phase after every RTT the congestion window size increments
  exponentially.
** Congestion Avoidance Phase
- This phase starts after the threshold value also denoted as
  ssthresh.
** Congestion Detection Phase
- If congestion occurs, the congestion window size is decreased.
- The only way a sender can guess that congestion has occurred is the
  need to retransmit a segment.

* TCP timer management and transaction in TCP
TCP implementation uses four timers:
** Retransmission Timer
- To retransmit lost segments, TCP uses retransmission timer.
- When TCP sends a segement the timer starts and stops when the
  acknowledgment is received.
- If the timer expires timeout occurs and the segement is retransmitted.
** Persistent Timer
- To deal with a zero-window-size deadlock situation, TCP uses a
  persistence timer.
- When the TCP receives an acknowledgment with a window size of zero,
  it starts a persistence timer.
- When the persistence timer goes off, the TCP sending sends a special
  segment called a probe.
- The probe causes the receiving TCP to resend the acknowledgment
  which was lost.
** Keep Alive Timer
- Used to prevent a long idle connection between two TCP's.
- If a client opens a TCP connection to a server transfers some data
  and becomes silent the client will crash.
- In this case, the connection remains open forever.
- To avoid such case Keep Alive Timer are used.
** Time Wait Timer
- 
* TODO Sliding window protocol
** Receiver
- The TCP window size (aka receive window) is the amount of free space
  in the server's receive buffer.
- It provides a limit to the amount of data the sender can transmit.
** Sender
- The client has send a window to match the server's receive window.
- The size of the window is the total number of bytes that the client
  is allowed to have unacknowledge at a time.
* Issues of session layer
** Establish sessions between machines
- The establishment of session between machines is an important
  service provided by session layer.
- Responsible for creating a dialog between connected machines.
- The session layer provides mechanism for opening, closing, and
  managing a session between end-user application processes.
** Enhanced Services
- Certain services such as checkpoints and management of tokens are
  the key features of session layer.
** To help in Token management and Synchronization
- The session layer plays an important role in preventing collision of
  several critical operation as well as ensuring better data transfer
  by establishing synchronization.
