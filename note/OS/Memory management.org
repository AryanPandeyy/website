* TODO Paging
- Technique which allows physical address space of the process to be noncontigous.
* Difference Between Paging and Segmentation

| Parameters       | Paging                                                                                                | Segmentation                                                                                                               |

| Logical Address  | CPU generates logical address and it is divided into 2 parts:a page number (p) and a page offset (d). | Logical address is divided into 2 parts:segment number (s) and offset (d)                                                  |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Table Index      | Page number is used as an index into a page table.                                                    | Segment number is used as index to the segement table.                                                                     |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base Address     | Base address of each page is used as an index into a page table                                       | Segement base indicates starting physical address of the segement in main memory and it also denotes length of the segment |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Address | Combination of base address with page offset defines the physical memory                              | Same as above                                                                                                              |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fragmentation    | Suffer through internal fragmentation                                                                 | Suffer through external fragmentation.                                                                                     |

* Demand Paging
- Pages are brought in main memory from secondary storage on demand.
- When needed to execute a process, memory manager swap it into memory.
- Instead of swaping entrie process into memory. It allows to swap in
  only those pages which are required for execution at that time.
- Disk operation is initiated by OS handler to read the required page
  in memory.
  - After this, mapping of page to free frame is carried out.
- This approach of fetching pages as they are needed for execution is
  called demand paging.
- Advantages:
  - Memory is utilized more efficiently.
  - Provide large size virtual memory.
- Disadvantages:
  - Page interrupts requires more number of table handling and
    processor overhed with compare to simple paged management
    techniques.
* Thrashing
- A process should have some minimum number of frames.
- If these numbers of frames are not available to the process then it
  will quickly page fault.
- Since in paging, pages are transferred between main memory and disk,
  this has an enormous overhead.
- Because of this frequent movement of pages between main memory and
  disk, system throughput reduces.
- This frequent paging activity causing the reduction in system
  throughput called as thrashing.
- Due to thrashing CPU utilization goes low.
- This thrashing can be limited by using local page replacement
  algorithm instead of global page replacement algorithm.
