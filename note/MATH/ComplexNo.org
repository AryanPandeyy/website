* Cauchy's Integral Thm:-
- If a complex function f(x) is analytic on a simple closed curve c then
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\int_c f(c)dz=0
\end{equation}
- NOTE:
  1. $|Z| = r$ $C(0,0)$ Radius r
  2. $|Z-a| = r$ $C(a,0)$ Radius r
  3. $|Z-b| = r$ $C(0,b)$ Radius r
  4. $|Z-(a+\iota b)| = r$ $C(a,b)$ Radius r
** Cauchy's Integral Formula:-
- If f(x) is an analytic function in a closed curve c and if a any
  point- within c then
\begin{equation}
f(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi \imath} \int_c \frac{f(c)}{z-a} dz \\
\therefore \int_c \frac{f(c)}{z-a}dz=2\pi \imath f(a)
\end{equation}
- Note:- Differentiate enq(1) w.r.t a partially n times
  both sides
\begin{equation}
\int_c \frac{f(x)}{(z-a)^{n}}=\frac{2\pi \imath}{n-1!} f^{n-1}(a)
\end{equation}
- First check the denominator and equate it to zero.
- Match with the constraint and the one who is lying outside, shift it to numerator.
* Taylor and Laurent Series
** Taylor Series
- This expansion is only possible when the function is analytic.
- $(1+x)^{-1} = 1-x+x^2-x^3$
- $(1-x)^{-1} = 1+x+x^2+x^3$
- Make condition equals to =t= for example $z-1=0$ then the condition
  will be $z-1=t$ and put this equation in the rest of the question
  replacing the variable with t.
- Then try to make it such that you can apply the binomial formula.
** Laurent Series
- This expansion is also possible when the function is not analytic.
- Here too binomial formula will be used.
- Condition will be in the form of less than.
  - We have to make $z<1$
  - Example: $1<|Z|<2$ then the condition will be like
    \begin{equation}
    1<|Z| \\
    \therefore \frac{1}{|Z|} < 1
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    |Z|<2 \\
    \therefore \frac{|Z|}{2} < 1
    \end{equation}
  - Example: $|Z|>2$
    \begin{equation}
    2<|Z|
    \therefore \frac{2}{|Z|} < 1
    \therefore \frac{1}{|Z|} < 1
    \end{equation}
* Cauchy's Residue Theorem
- Cauchy state that integral of analytic closed curve is zero.
- But there are some points in the closed curve in which function is
  *not analytic*. Those points are known as *Poles*.
- Poles $Z, Z_1,\dots Z_n$
  \begin{equation}
  \int_c f(z) \mathrm{d}z=2\pi\iota(R_1+R_2+\dots R_n)
  \end{equation}
- NOTE:
  1. Residue at Simple Pole at $Z=a$
     \begin{equation}
     f(x)=\lim\limits_{z \to a} (z-a)f(z)
     \end{equation}
  2. Residue at =a= pole of order =n=
     \begin{equation}
     Res(at z = a) =\lim\limits_{z \to a} \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \frac{\mathrm d^{n-1}}{\mathrm d z^{n-1}} (z-a)^n f(z)
     \end{equation}
  3. Residue at \infty
     \begin{equation}
     R=\lim\limits_{z \to \infty} -z f(z)
     \end{equation}
- Any question which is been solved by Cauchy's Integral can also be
  solved with Cauchy's Residue.
- How to find pole?
  - Equate denominator to zero and if all the values are distinct then
    it is a *simple pole* and if two values are *being repeated* then its pole order is 2.
