* Primal to Dual
- Optimal equation should be in *Minimize*.
- $\geq$ should be the sign of all the constraints.
- Duality:
  1. $Min\implies Max$
  2. R.H.S of constraints will be the optimal equation.
  3. L.H.S of constraints vertically will form new constraints.
  4. All the $\geq$ will get convert into $\leq$
  5. $C_j-Z_j$ should be less than or equal to zero then the equation is optimal.
     1. Select the highest positive number in $C_j-Z_j$ term.
     2. Minimium ratio will be applied here too.
     3. Rest all is same.
