* Data Transfer Techniques
** Programmed I/O
[[../../img/programmedio.png]]
- In this method CPU has direct control over I/O.
- The processor check status of the devices and issues read or write
  commands if they are ready. During checking the status of devices
  CPU waits for I/O module and hence this system wastes the CPU time.
- Sequence of operations to be carried out in Programmed I/O:
  1. Explain the diagram
** Interrupt Driven
[[../../img/interrupt.png]]
- Interrupt Driven I/O overcomes the disadvantage of programmed I/O
  i.e. the CPU waiting for I/O device.
- This is overcome by not repeatedly checking the status of I/O
  devices instead the I/O module interrupts when ready.
- Sequence of operations for interrupt Driven I/O:
  1. Explain diagram
** I/O and DMA
- DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. The I/O module can directly
  access the memory using this method.
- Interrupt driven and programmed I/O require active operations of the
  CPU. DMA is the solution for these problems.
- DMA controller takes over the control of the bus from CPU for I/O
  transfer.
- DMA controller sends the signals when its finished.
- Advantages:
  - CPU carries on with other work while the DMA controller deals with
    transfer of data.
