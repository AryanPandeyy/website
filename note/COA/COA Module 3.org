* Control Units
** Hardwired Control Unit Design Methods
- Combinational logic ciruits.
- Generate a set of fixed sequences of control signals.
- Advantages
  - Higher speed of operation.
  - Smaller space req on silicon wafer i.e. IC.
- Disadvantages
  - Modification to the design are difficult.
- Use in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer][RISC Designs]].
- Methods to implement hardwired control unit:
  1. [[*State Table Method][State Table Method]]
  2. [[*Delay Element Method][Delay Element Method]]
  3. [[*Sequence Counter Method][Sequence Counter Method]]
  4. [[*PLA Method][PLA Method]]
*** State Table Method
- State table is combine to form a instruction.
- All instruction are considered as inputs.
- State table is then implemented using flipflops and combinational ciruits
  to generate different control signals.
*** Delay Element Method
- Implemented using delay element i.e. D-flipflops.
- A flipflop give output logic '1' after specific event (t-state)
  and output is used to generate control signals.
*** Sequence Counter Method
- Counter keeps on incrementing and generating diff counts.
- Counts are decoded using decoder.
- And the output is used as control signals.
*** PLA Method
- Programmable Logic Array.
- PLA is an array of AND gates as input and the OR gates as output.
- Input to the AND array is from various control signals generated.
- And the output of the OR array is given as control signals.
** Soft Wired Unit Design Methods
- Micro programmed control unit generates control signals based on
  microinstructions stored in control memory.
- Each instruction loads the control signals in control register.
- These control signals are given to microinstructions register,
  decoded and then given to the individual components.
* Nano Programming
[[../../img/get-user.png]]
- Microprogram memory contains pointers to the actual microinstructions.
- Microinstructions register points to the nanoinstruction memory.
- Nanoinstruction memory contains actual micro-instruction.
* Flynn's Classification
- Classification based on no. of Instruction Streams (IS) and Data
  Streams (DS) in the system.
- Parallel processing intro four categories:
  1. [[*Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)][Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)]]
  2. [[*Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)][Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)]]
  3. [[*Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)][Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)]]
  4. [[*Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)][Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)]]
** Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)
- Single processor that executes one instruction at a time on single
  data stored in the memory.
** Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
- Same instruction is given to multiple processing elements, but diff
  data.
** Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)
- Multiple Instruction streams and hence multiple control units to
  decode these instructions.
- Each control unit takes a diff instruction from the diff memory
  module in the same memory.
** Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)
- Each processing element is having a diff set of data and diff
  instruction.
* Instruction Pipeline
- Technique for overlapping the execution of several instructions to
  reduce the execution time of a set of instructions.
- Latency: The amount of time that a single operation takes to
  execute.
- Throughput: The rate at which operations get executed.
  In a non-pipelined processor,
  $$Throughput=\frac{1}{latency}$$
  In a pipelined processor,
  $$Throughput>\frac{1}{latency}$$
- Advantages
  - Rate at which instruction executes is increased
** Unpipelined approach
- Processor fetches an instruction from memory.
- Decodes it to determine what the instruction was.
- Read inputs from register files and perfrom operation on them given
  by instruction.
- Writes result back in register files.
- (Instruction fetch, instruction decode, register read, instruction
  execution and register write-back)
- Disadvantages
  - Most of hardware is idle waiting for others to complete their
    task.
* Pipeline Hazards
- Pipelining increases processor performance by increasing
  instruction.
- Several instructions are overlapped resulting the rate at which
  instruction executes.
- Type of conflicts
  1. [[*Structural Hazards (Resource Conflicts)][Structural Hazards (Resource Conflicts)]]
  2. [[*Data Hazards (Data Dependency Conflicts)][Data Hazards (Data Dependency Conflicts)]]
  3. [[*Branch Difficulties (Control Hazards)][Branch Difficulties (Control Hazards)]]
*** Structural Hazards (Resource Conflicts)
- Caused by access to memory by two instructions at the same time.
- Can be resolved by using separate instruction and data memories.
- Occurs when processor's hardware is not capable of execu all the
  instruction in the pipeline simultaneously.
*** TODO Data Hazards (Data Dependency Conflicts)
- Caused when an instruction depends on the result of a prev
  instruction, but this result is not yet avail.
*** TODO Branch Difficulties (Control Hazards)
- To Be Edited.
* TODO Micro-operations
